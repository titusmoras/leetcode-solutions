#Given a table salary, such as the one below, that has m=male and f=female values.
#Swap all f and m values (i.e., change all f values to m and vice versa) with a single update query
#and no intermediate temp table.
#

# Write your MySQL query statement below
update salary set sex =(case sex when 'm' then 'f' else 'm' end);
